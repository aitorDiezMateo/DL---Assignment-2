# Deep Learning Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a **Deep Learning-based Movie Recommendation System**. The project serves as an introductory exercise in neural networks and deep learning, leveraging **PyTorch** to predict user preferences based on their past movie ratings. The recommendation model is built using the **MovieLens** dataset and follows standard steps in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that predicts user preferences by utilizing deep learning techniques. The system is designed to help users discover new movies based on their past ratings, enhancing user experience.

## Dataset

This project uses the **MovieLens dataset**. You can choose from the following versions based on the available time and resources:

- **MovieLens 100k** (100,000 ratings)
- **MovieLens 1M** (1 million ratings)
- **MovieLens 10M** (10 million ratings)

You can download the dataset [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

## Suggested Steps

1. **Download and Preprocess the Dataset**:
   - Download the MovieLens dataset and preprocess the data to extract the relevant information (user ratings, movie IDs, etc.).
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Implement Neural Network Architecture**:
   - Design a neural network architecture that predicts movie ratings for users.
   - The model should take user and movie IDs as input and output the predicted rating.

3. **Train and Evaluate the Model**:
   - Train the model using the training data and evaluate it on the validation and test sets.
   - Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's performance.

4. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Enhance the model by incorporating content-based information (genre, director, actors) or using advanced architectures like matrix factorization, autoencoders, or deep collaborative filtering.
